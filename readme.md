_powering all sorts of CLI games_

Creeplib aims to provide a powerful library for rendering and writing the logic
behind command-line games. I started out wanting to write a command-line
turret defense game (the browser ones get to the point where drawing graphics
takes 1-2 seconds per frame!), then remembered things like _picnic defense_
which are turret-oriented but the creeps may move freely over the map.

Instead of trying to write N games I want to play, I'm going to write the simple
turrent defense game and power it using a general-purpose library.
